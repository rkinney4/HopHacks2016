# HopHacks 2016: Teaching Amazon Alexa to use GitHub
#### Rachel Kinney and Edmund Duhaime

We have created a skill for Amazon Alexa that alows Alexa to interface with GitHub's API.

#### You can ask Alexa to:

  - Get the current branch
  - List all branches
  - Switch branches
  - Get the most recent commit
  - Get the last `n` commits
  - List all contributors
  - List the top three contributors

#### Public APIs and Services used:

  - [GitHub]
  - [Alexa Skills Kit]
  - [AWS Lambda]
